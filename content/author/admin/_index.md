I am a post doctoral researcher in the field of Mathematical Programming and
Optimisation. Currently, I am part of the optimisation team in the CERMICS
laboratory at École des Ponts, France. Before then, I completed my PhD in my home
country of New Zealand; my thesis focused on risk aversion in multistage
stochastic optimisation problems, and can be found here.

My research spans many areas of stochastic optimisation -- in particular, developing
and analysing algorithms for large scale problems involving uncertainty and multiple stages.
